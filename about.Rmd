## Currently

I'm a data scientist at [Cone Health](https://www.conehealth.com/) in Greensboro, NC. I come to the world of healthcare after nearly ten years in manufacturing and two in higher education. My interests are in: 

* General Data Science

* Bayesian Inference

* Causal Inference

* Econometrics

* Survey Analysis

* Applied Machine Learning and Prediction

* Simulation and Optimization

Additionally, I am an advocate for improving mobility. In my spare time I volunteer as a member of the Winston-Salem Transportation Coalition where we advocate for better public transit. I employ data science techniques in order to quantify and shed light on the issues. 

You can read more about my work [here](presentations.html). Additionally, I maintain a site regarding local politics and economic analysis. You can read that [here](https://www.nctriadresearch.com/).

## Before

I came into statistics and data science from chemical engineering (which is what I studied at University). I also minored in philosophy and wrote my honors thesis in the English department.

After graduation I worked in industrial engineering at Michelin North America in plant industrial engineering and continuous improvement and at the central level in industrial engineering, project management and decision support and analysis.
