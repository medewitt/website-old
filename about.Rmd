# Currently

I'm a data scientist at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, NC. I come to the world of higher education after nearly ten years in manufacturing. My interests are in: 

* General Data Science

* Bayesian Statistics

* Causal Inference

* Survey Analysis

* Applied Machine Learning and Prediction

Additionally, I am an advocate for improving mobility. In my spare time I volunteer as a member of the Winston-Salem Transportation Coalition where we advocate for better public transit. I employ data science techniques in order to quantify and shed light on the issues.

# Before

I came into statistics and data science from chemical engineering (which is what I studied at University). I also minored in philosophy and wrote my honors thesis in the English department. The liberal arts greatly increased my ability to communicate complex topics, simply. 

After graduation I worked in industrial engineering at Michelin North America in plant industrial engineering and continuous improvement and at the central level in industrial engineering, project management and decision support and analysis.
