This is a blog for me to capture things I see, musing and other ramblings. Additionally, by writing and thinking about things I provide a way to index my thoughts and capture examples for use in other parts of my work. 

This is certainly a work in progress and a way to help myself continue to learn new tricks, techniques, methods and tools. There will be typographical errors, but I will do my best to avoid them for the casual reader.
