      <description>Not really a post about statistics, but I must say that moving past the vanilla blogdown hugo themes one encounters a lot of hang ups and issues. I think this is partly because many themes havenâ€™t been tested yet, which is foolish on my part, but also because the platform itself is pretty intricate. I sincerely appreciate Yihui Xie et al creating blogdown because it certainly has made this kind of blogging more accessible (easier) than say blogdown or spinnning up a WP site.</description>
