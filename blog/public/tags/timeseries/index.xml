      <description>Bayesian methods are where we need to go. I have pretty strong opinions on this as Bayes provides a way to attune for our prior understanding of the world, move away from null hypothesis testing and take advantage of prior work. Additionally, hierarchical modeling provides a way to collectively pool strength when you have a smaller number of data points. All in all it is a great way to do analysis.</description>
