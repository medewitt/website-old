I'm Michael DeWitt.
I'm a data scientist and applied statistician working in health care and healthcare analytics.
Additionally, I have experience in manufacturing and higher education.
My interests are in Bayesian inference, econometrics, survey analysis, forecasting, and causal inference. 

In addition to my professional work, I apply the tools of the trade on local community projects and subjects of interest.
This includes analysis of local economic policy, transportation availability, policing, and politics. I'm passionate about data informed policy and decision-making and scientific communication in general.
